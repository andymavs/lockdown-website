### What is Lockdown?
Lockdown is a Cyber Security competition.

### Who can compete?
We ask that only beginners in Cyber Security compete for the fairness of the competition. For example, if you would compete at [NECCDC](http://neccdc.net/), this would not be the competition for you.

### Where is it hosted?
Lockdown is hosted at the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/), Capen Hall, Room 201. Directions will be posted shortly.

### I have more questions!
Great! Email the competition organizer at [jamesdro@buffalo.edu](mailto:jamesdro@buffalo.edu?subject=Lockdown Question) with any questions you have!
