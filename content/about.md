### What is Lockdown?
Lockdown is a Cyber Security competition.

### Who can compete?
We ask that only beginners in Cyber Security compete for the fairness of the competition. For example, if you would compete at [NECCDC](http://neccdc.net/), this would not be the competition for you.

### When is it?
Lockdown v0 is scheduled on **April 9th, 2016 from 10AM to 5PM**. A schedule of events is located [here](/schedule).

### Where is it hosted?
Lockdown is hosted at the University at Buffalo, Capen Hall, Room 201A. Directions can be found [here](/directions).

### Do you have any resources you recommend?
Absolutely! We recommend you check out our [Beginner's Security Guide](/guide).

### I have more questions!
Great! Email the competition organizer at [jamesdro@buffalo.edu](mailto:jamesdro@buffalo.edu?subject=Lockdown Question) with any questions you have!
