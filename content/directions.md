On the [following map](http://www.buffalo.edu/buildings/maps/NorthCampus.pdf), Capen Hall is building #25.  It is suggested that you park in the Fronczak A/B, Hochstetter B or Jacobs A lots.  You may park in any of the regular spots in any lot without a permit on the weekend.

Once inside Capen Hall, you should enter the Silverman library and head up to the second floor.  Do not use the elevator in the lobby of Capen Hall - you must first enter the library and then head to the second floor.  Currently the only way to enter the second floor is through the elevators located inside the library.
